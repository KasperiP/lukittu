      description: |
        This endpoint is used to validate a license key with the Lukittu backend. 
        Typically, you should call this endpoint when your software starts and act based on the response provided.

        **Important Note**: If you are using a programming language that supports loading business logic code remotely 
        (e.g., Java with a Remote ClassLoader), you should not use this endpoint. Instead, use the "classloader" endpoint for enhanced security.

      summary: 'License Heartbeat'
      operationId: 'licenseHeartbeat'
      description: |
        The Heartbeat endpoint is used to determine whether a specific device is still active. 
        You should call this endpoint at regular intervals (e.g., once every 30 minutes). 
        This process also validates the license key in a similar way to the Verify License endpoint.
